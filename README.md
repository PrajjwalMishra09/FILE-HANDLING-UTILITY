DURATION: 6 WEEKS  

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH  

DESCEIPTION: As part of my 6-week Java Programming internship at Codetech IT Solutions under the guidance of my mentor Neela Santosh, I was assigned Task 1: File Handling Utility. This task focused on creating a Java program capable of performing basic file operations — writing to a file, reading from a file, and modifying an existing file by appending new content. The objective was to build a script demonstrating these essential file handling operations while ensuring clean, readable code with appropriate documentation and comments for better understanding and future reference.

To complete this task, I chose Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my primary code editor. VS Code is a lightweight yet powerful open-source editor developed by Microsoft that supports multiple programming languages, including Java. Its integrated terminal, syntax highlighting, IntelliSense code suggestions, and debugging tools make it highly efficient for Java development. I configured VS Code by installing the ‘Extension Pack for Java’, which includes Language Support for Java™ by Red Hat, Debugger for Java, Maven for Java, and other essential tools. This setup created a smooth development environment to write, execute, and test Java programs.

For compiling and running the program, I used Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21, which is currently the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) release from Oracle. The JDK was installed and configured through the system’s environment variables, enabling direct command-line execution from the terminal in VS Code.

In order to better understand Java’s file handling mechanism, I referred to several reliable open-source documentation and tutorials. The official Oracle Java Documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/index.html) was one of the primary references, providing detailed information about the java.io and java.nio.file packages, and the various classes such as FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and Scanner. Additionally, I consulted articles and code snippets from open-source coding platforms like GeeksforGeeks, W3Schools, and JavaPoint. These resources offered practical examples of file operations, which helped me structure my program effectively.

The program was designed in a modular way, with three dedicated methods: writeFile(), readFile(), and modifyFile(). Each method performs a specific operation while handling exceptions to ensure the program runs smoothly without abrupt termination. Comments were added throughout the code to explain the purpose of each block and line, making it easier for other developers or students to understand the logic.

A Scanner object was used to take dynamic user inputs from the console, allowing the program to interactively write and append content to a text file named example.txt. After every write or modify operation, the content of the file was displayed on the terminal to verify the changes in real-time. The program was tested multiple times with different inputs to validate its accuracy and reliability.

To enhance my efficiency and clarify certain syntax-related doubts, I occasionally sought minor assistance from OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The AI tool was particularly useful in verifying Java syntax conventions and suggesting optimized coding practices. However, the core development, structuring, and implementation of the program were carried out manually using the aforementioned documentation and tutorials.

In conclusion, this file handling task greatly enhanced my practical knowledge of Java’s file input/output operations and improved my ability to work with external files in a controlled, efficient, and error-free manner. It also familiarized me with modern development tools like VS Code, open-source Java resources, and best practices for writing clean, well-documented Java code. This task serves as a foundational component for developing more complex file-based applications in the future.
